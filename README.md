# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-Classification
In these project the objective is to classify the reviews as useful and not useful instantly on the basis of the Previous reviews. So, the customer will not be biased towards older reviews.
I used used the BOW, TFIDF text preprocessing techniques in these peoject and also used the Word2vec in gensim to get the similar words to a particular word.
I have built different classification models like Logostic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest with GridsearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning.
